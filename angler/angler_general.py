def FISH_finder(img,thresh,exclude_border):
    '''
    This function finds the coordinates of local maxima in max-projected FISH
    data.

    It uses peak_local_max from skimage.feature module.  If two local maxima
    happen to be on proximity of 20 pixel,only the brighter one will be kept.

    Parameters:
    img: 2-D ndarray (i.e,single channel) 

    min_distance= minimum distance of two FISH spot
    
    thresh: flaot 0.0-1.0 relative threshold of the peaks value, compared to maximum value of the image.
    
    exclude_border: int excludes local peaks that are in the border of an
    image.


    Returns:
    ndarray: (row, column, â€¦) coordinates of peaks.
